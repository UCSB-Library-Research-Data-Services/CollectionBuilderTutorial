For this tutorial, we will be using a small collection of vintage postcards from a private collection. These postcards feature various landmarks and scenes from around the world, and they will serve as the primary content for our exhibit.\nTo get started, download the images for this tutorial from postcards.zip. Unzip the file and save the images to a folder on your computer where you can easily access them later.",

    "text": "Step 3: Fill in the metadata\n\nCreate the metadata for your exhibit by filling in the Google Sheets template. Each row in the spreadsheet represents an item in your collection, and each column corresponds to a specific metadata field. Some of the key columns you will need to fill out include:\n\n\n\n\nColumn Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nobjectid\nA unique identifier for each item (e.g., postcard1, postcard2).\n\n\nformat\nMIME Type format of the object; e.g., ‘image/jpg’, ‘image/png’, ‘application/pdf’\n\n\nfilename\nThe name of the file associated with the item (e.g., postcard1.jpg).\n\n\ntitle\nThe title of the item (e.g., Eiffel Tower Postcard).\n\n\ndescription\nA brief description of the item (e.g., A vintage postcard featuring the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.).\n\n\ndate\nThe date associated with the item (e.g., 1920s).\n\n\nsubject\nA list of keywords or subjects related to the item, separated by semicolons (e.g., landmark; Paris; vintage).\n\n\nlocation\nThe location associated with the item (e.g., Paris, France).\n\n\nlatitude\nThe latitude coordinate of the item’s location (e.g., 48.8584).\n\n\nlongitude\nThe longitude coordinate of the item’s location (e.g., 2.2945).\n\n\nlanguage\nThe language of the item’s description (e.g., en).\n\n\n\nNot all fields are mandatory, but we recommend filling out as many as possible to enhance the discoverability and richness of your exhibit. The objectid, format, and filename fields are essential for linking your metadata to the corresponding media files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave your metadata\n\n\n\nCollectionBuilder requires that you save your Google Sheets metadata as a CSV file. To do this, go to File &gt; Download &gt; Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) in the Google Sheets menu. Save the CSV file to a location on your computer and name it as metadata.csv.\nDon’t open the CSV file in Excel or any other spreadsheet software, as this can alter the formatting and cause issues when uploading to CollectionBuilder.",
